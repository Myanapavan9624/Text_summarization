# Text_summarization

With the advancement of technology, text is abundant in today's world especially on
the web. Therefore, it is important to summarize the text so that it becomes easier to
read and understand while maintaining the essence and context of the information.
Automatic text summarization is an effective way of finding relevant and important
information precisely in large text in a short amount of time with little efforts. In this
project, we propose a abstractive text summarization model using NLP techniques and
Transformer model that can understand the context of the entire text, identify the most
important portions of the text and generate coherent summaries.
Automated Essay Grading systems are blessings to the educational community where
teachers normally face lots of problem while correcting studentâ€™s essays. Evaluation of
huge amount of student essays within stipulated time, with feedback is a real challenge.
Text grading is also an important part of the project where we grade the content using
Lasso regression based on various features calculated using NLP techniques and
different tokenization methods.
In this project, we propose a web application which consists of Automatic text
summarization and Automated Essay Grading modules to help students prepare and
practice for their academic and competitive exams. Summarization can be a crucial
component in the tele-health supply chain when it comes to analyzing medical
cases and routing these to the appropriate health professional. Summarization can also
help us extract important content from mail, social media etc. Text Grading is useful
for improving the content in blogs, articles and many more journals. This can also be
used by students to know any discrepancies in their articles.
